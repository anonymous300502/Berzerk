- `detect_users.py` - It lets you see the available victims you can connect to using the C2 server.
- `berzerk.ps1` - It is the main paylod to be installed in the victim PC, preferably in post exploitation scenario as a backdoor.

## Instructions to run
* __Pre-requisites:__
	-  Latest version of python and flask.

* __Setup on the victim PC__
	- Transfer the `berzerk.ps1` into the victim PC and preferably store it in the startup folder for future easy access, Change the IP and PORT as per your values

* __Setup on attacker PC__
  - Open your server in a terminal, go in the folder where the repository is cloned.
  - Configure the server IP and Port for the flask server in both `berzerk.py` and `detect_users.py` if required.
